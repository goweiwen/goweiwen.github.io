For [Pixelect](https://github.com/anaprimawaty/pixelect), our team used Vue.js for the frontend.

Vue's documentation has a [good comparison between it and React](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/comparison.html). If you haven't read that, I suggest reading that first, then coming back here.

## Vue uses templates instead of JSX
* inline css
* jsx is not html


## Vue has a Smaller Ecosystem

## Vue has less Tooling Support
