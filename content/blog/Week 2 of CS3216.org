Week 2 of hell ends with two deliverables due on Friday, 23:59.

I completed my team's Orbital presentation on Wednesday. One of the advisors for the Orbital project was an alumni of CS3216 who also took it during his year 2, and mentioned that he tells everyone not to take it during year 2 after his experience. That scares me, but I'm willing to tackle whatever obstacle CS3216 throws at me.

At the presentation, I bumped into another pair from this year's intake. One of them made an impression on me during the first lecture because he was a front end developer coming from an Engineering background. He signed up together with a friend from Computing, but they later mentioned that they had both dropped the module.

I really enjoyed this week's lecture, which taught us important software engineering principles, such as testing and code style. These principles are analogous to keeping your workspace tidy, which allows you to jump right into code that you haven't touched for a while and quickly familiarise yourself with it.

For assignment 1, our team is using JavaScript for both the front end and back end. We use [[https://eslint.org/][ESLint]] with the [[https://standardjs.com/][JavaScript Standard Style]], along with the [[https://github.com/prettier/prettier-eslint][Prettier]] plugin, which allows us to run =eslint --fix= to automatically format our code according to the specified rules. This allows us to focus on the actual product instead of inconsequential details such as indentation style and semicolons.

Two weeks down, eleven (?) more to go.
