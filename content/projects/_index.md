### Pear

![Pear](/images/pear.png)

[Pear](https://github.com/Pear-App/pear-client) is an iOS and Android app where users matchmake their friends. This reduces sign-up friction for users as they only require a friend to sign them up and write a description on their behalf.

It was released as a Progressive Web App (PWA), as well as to iOS App Store and Google Play Store and hit 300 users within 24 hours.

Pear won 2nd prize for CS3216 Software Product Engineering for Digital Markets in NUS School of Computing Term Project Showcase (11th STePS).

I led the front-end development, using Vue.js and Cordova.
